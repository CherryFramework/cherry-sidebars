Cherry Sidebars allows to create and manage your own dynamic sidebars.

== Description ==

Cherry Sidebars is a lightweight plugin for creating multiple widget areas, and outputting them on posts or pages of your choosing. Now you don't have to limit yourself to one widget area, instead you can create as many as you like. Group your widgets into multiple areas, and pick which one you want to display for a certain post or page.
The plugin can be useful for certain posts or pages, where you want your content to be different, for example you need to add a banner ad to your popular post, or a bio section to the 'About' page. Cherry Sidebars would be a perfect tool for this task.

2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the "Widgets" section to start customizing (Please notice! Some themes that do not support widgets may not have such page)
